%let var1 = some value;
%let var2 = some other value;
%let varNum = 1;

%macro testMacro(param1);
    this text will show whenever the macro is called.

    variables can be referenced like this: &var1.
    variables can be nested to form references to other variables: &var&varNum..

    we can reference macro parameters just like variables: &param1.
    ...and also nest these as with variables: &var&param1..
%mend;

here's how you call a macro:
%exec testMacro(1);

here's a call to the same macro with a different parameter:
%exec testMacro(2);

this is how you execute a loop:
%procloop (3) loopCounter;
    this loop will execute &loopCounter. times.
%pend;

...you can also use a variable to set the number of iterations:
%let loopVar0 = first loop;
%let loopVar1 = second loop;
%let loopVar2 = third loop;
%let loopVar3 = fourth loop;
%let numLoops = 4;
%procloop (&numLoops.) counterVar;
    this other loop will execute &counterVar. times, and references a different variable each time: &loopVar&counterVar..
%pend;
