this is how you execute a loop:
%procloop (3) loopCounter;
    this loop will execute &loopCounter. times.
%pend;

...you can also use a variable to set the number of iterations:
%let loopVar0 = first loop;
%let loopVar1 = second loop;
%let loopVar2 = third loop;
%let loopVar3 = fourth loop;
%let numLoops = 4;
%procloop (&numLoops.) counterVar;
    this other loop will execute &counterVar. times, and references a different variable each time: &loopVar&counterVar..
%pend;
